My solution to the reverse words problem:
Given a list of space separated words, reverse the order of the words. Each line of text contains L letters and W words.
A line will only consist of letters and space characters. There will be exactly one space character between each pair of consecutive words.

Solution:
The basic algorithm would simply be to add each word seperately to a list and then use an stl algorithm to reverse the list.
However, in this solution I'll implement the reverse algorithm myself.

main.cpp:
Read in the file. Iterate through each test case. Construct a vector with the list of words in reverse. Print out the vector.
